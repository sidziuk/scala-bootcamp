# Scala Bootcamp

This repository contains information on the [Evolution Gaming](https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/) Scala Bootcamp.

## Schedule

[2023 Q1-Q2 bootcamp schedule](Schedule.md)

## Preparation for the bootcamp

### Prerequisites

Please install recent versions of the following before the first lecture:
- [intelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Scala plug-in](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html) for IntelliJ IDEA
- Java Development Kit (JD), such as OpenJDK, e.g. [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Alternatives that are also expected to work:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with [Metals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals) as an IDE (to replace `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition` and `Scala plug-in` respectively)
- Using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing [OpenJDK](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openjdk) (for MacOS)
- Using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) for installing the JDK

### Prepare the project

- Check out the [Scala Bootcamp](https://github.com/evolution-gaming/scala-bootcamp) project
- Run tests from the command line using `sbt test`
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run tests there (right-click on `scala-bootcamp` project in the left panel and click `Run ScalaTests in ‘scala…’`)

The tests will fail (for now), this is normal and expected.

If the tests do not compile, this is usually because the JDK used is too old. Make sure you use a recent JDK.

### Troubleshooting

In case of issues:
- Read [Getting Started with Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html)
- Read [Discover IntelliJ IDEA for Scala](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html)
- Ask in the Bootcamp chat
