// *Introduction*
//
// The feature which is not written, contains no bugs. If avoiding implementing
// a feature, or simplifying the feature could be done, we go for it, we learn
// to say "no". The largest complication on this level is striking the right
// balance between keeping the things simple and actually achieving what the
// business needs.
//
// Note: Sometimes people are not using this layer enough.
