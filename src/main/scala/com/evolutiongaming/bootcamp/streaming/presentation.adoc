= Introduction to streaming libraries

== What are they

Streams are more wide and general than you can think. If we look around, all processes in our life can be considered in terms of streams.

// Table borrowed from Monix documentation

* A kind of collection, with focus on not storing all elements at once, potentially and usually infinite
* Supports asynchronous transformations
* Handles backpressure

== Backpressure

Consider a system with a producer continually sending data to a consumer.

[mermaid]
....
graph LR
Producer -- Data --> c[Consumer]
....

Those can be chained.

[mermaid]
....
graph LR
Producer --> Consumer/Producer --> Consumer
....

What if producer can generate more data than consumer can process?

[mermaid]
....
graph LR
P["Produces 100 items/second"] --> C["Can process 75 items/second"]
....

Extra 25 items/second have to be dealt with.

Backpressure refers to the ability of producer to slow down
to match downstream processing speed.

== Typical architectures
=== Push-based
[mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
participant P as Producer
participant CP as Consumer/Producer
participant C as Consumer

activate P
P ->> CP: Data
deactivate P
activate CP
CP ->> C: Data
deactivate CP
activate C
C --) CP: I'm done
deactivate C
CP --) P: I'm done
....

Producer keeps sending data to consumer, and there's a way for consumer to slow down producer.

* Easier buffering/throttling
* Easier time-based operations, e.g. "take elements in first 10 seconds of stream"

=== Pull-based
[mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
participant P as Producer
participant CP as Consumer/Producer
participant C as Consumer

C ->> CP: Give me data
CP ->> P: Give me data
activate P
P -->> CP: Data
deactivate P
activate CP
CP -->> C: Data
deactivate CP
....

Producer does nothing until consumer explicitly requests data.

* Backpressured by construction
* Producer is essentially `F[Seq[Data]]`
* Generally easier to reason about

|Library|fs2|zio|akka-streams|monix (Observable)

|General info
|Purely functional, integrates very well with cats-effect. Built on recursive Pull data type
|Purely functional, is a part of ZIO ecosystem
|Internally runs on akka actors and integrates very well with them
|`Future`-based internals, mostly pure user-facing API. Implements ReactiveX in Scala. WARNING: It don't have CE3 compatible version hence can't be used in a project depending on CE3

|Push vs Pull based
|Pull
|Pull
|Push
|Push (has an `Iterant`, analog on fs2's `Pull` which is Pull based)

|Evaluated in
|Supports arbitrary `F` implementing cats-effect type classes
|Runs on ZIO
|Only accepts `Future` for async transformation and produces `Future` once materialized
|Supports arbitrary `F` implementing cats-effect type classes

|Basic concepts
|Source - `Stream[F, O]`, Pipe - `Pipe[F, O1, O2]`, Sink - `Stream[F, Unit]`, compiles into `F[A]` via `stream.compile.`
|Source - `ZStream[R, E, O]`, Pipe - `ZPipeline[R, E, O1, O2]`, Sink - `ZSink[R, E, I, L, Z]`, compiles into `ZIO[R, E, Z]` via `stream.run(sink)`
|Source - `Source[Out, Mat]`, Pipe - `Flow[In, Out, Mat]`, Sink - `Sink[In, Mat]`, materialises into `RunnableGraph[Mat3]` via `source.toMat(sink)((Mat, Mat2) => Mat3)`, `RunnableGraph` then ran with `graph.run()`
|Source - `Observable[O]`, Pipe - `Observable[O1] => Observable[O2]`, Sink - `Consumer[O, R]`, compiles into a `Task[R]` or `F[R]` via `observer.consumeWith(consumer)`

=== Others
* A number of java libraries: RxJava, Project Reactor, etc.

=== Interop

http://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams] - set of interfaces,
specifically for interoperation between streaming libraries while preserving backpressure.

All covered libraries allows us to implement systems following that.

== Format

* Word-count example
* Inputs
* Processing
** Asynchronous transformations
** Running FSMs, stateful transformations
* Outputs
* Non-linear pipelines


== Which library to use

* *The one already in classpath*
** `http4s` uses FS2
** `akka-http` uses Akka Streams
** `zio-http` uses zio-streams
* Consider integrations with other systems, e.g. Kafka clients.


== Learning more

* All covered libraries have excellent scaladocs
* Online documentation
** https://fs2.io/#/getstarted/install[FS2]
** https://zio.dev/reference/stream/[ZIO]
** https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html[Akka Streams]
** https://monix.io/docs/current/[Monix]


== Finite-state Machines
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine[Finite-state machine] is defined by

* Set of inputs `I`
* Set of states `S`, with designated initial state `S0`
* Transition function `(S, I) => S`, "when in state S and receiving input I, transition to another state"

Why:

* Processes inputs one at time
* Needs to keep only one element of state `S` in memory

Common subtypes:

* Acceptors: either accept input, or not. Also known as "regular expressions".
* Transducers: produce output depending on state/input
** There's an additional set of outputs `O`
** Transition function becomes `(S, I) => (S, O)`
