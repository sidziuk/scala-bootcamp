  /** *
    * Our lecture is dedicated to a library that is widely used within Scala community - Cats.
    * The name `Cats` alludes to Category theory and the library contains abstractions making our life
    * easier.
    * We will see some type classes that are useful in our daily work.
    * Quick re-cap: type classes allow us to extend functionality avoiding limitations of inheritance and in cases when
    * we can not modify the source code.
    *
    * Before peeking into the library, let's have a look at types you already familiar with: Option and Either.
    *
    * Q: what do you find especially useful about Option? Either?
    *
    * Essentially, Option[A] gives a reader of the code a clear and explicit message, that the value of type A may be
    * missing.
    * Thus, one must handle both cases, otherwise compiler (bless it!) would complain by showing a corresponding
    * warnings during compilation.
    * Another handy feature Option provides is ability to chain our computations via .map and .flatMap methods.
    *
    * What about Either?
    * Either[E, A] indicates that given computation may result with an error of type E or with a value of type A.
    * And it's also possible to chain computations using .map and .flatMap methods.
    *
    * An effect in functional programming is a concept of a model that has certain behavior with properties.
    * For example, Option[A] models an effect of optionality of a value, Either[E, A] models an effect of a failure.
    *
    * Consider  a following example:

  val savedEither: Either[String, Boolean] = findUserEither("Bob").map(upgrade).flatMap(saveUserEither)

  /** But what if we do not want ot opt-in to the concrete implementation?
    * It's the moment when type classes may help us: we demand a presence of Monad type class for our F[_].
    * Thus, we only care about .map and .flatMap implemented for our F.
    * Now we can change the effect without modifying the function implementation.
