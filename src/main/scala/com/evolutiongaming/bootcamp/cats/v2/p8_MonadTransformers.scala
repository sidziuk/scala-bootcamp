    * So far we've seen a nice way to chain our executions via .map and .flatMap
    * But what if we need to stack different effects together?
    * For example Option with Either?
    * The naive way would be to simply define our return type as follows:

        case None     => Right(None)

    case None       => Right(None)
  }

  /** Quite cumbersome, isn't it?
    * What if we had a better way?
    * It turns out there is one: monad transformers.
    * For example EitherT from Cats composes Either with other monads, OptionT composes Option, etc.
    * The type signatures of monad transformers are written from the inside out, thus an EitherT[Option, String, A] is
    * a wrapper for an Option[Either[String, A]].
    * It is often useful to use type aliases when writing transformer types for deeply nested monads.

  /** Drawbacks.
    * The cats implementation of monad transformers comes with a burden of extra memory allocation for each Wrapper.
    * Thus, the deeper our stack is the more memory we need per each call of .map or .flatMap in the context of the wrapper.
    * Good news are that it's quite rare situation (in my personal experience) when you need more than one transformer stacked.
    *
    * Some realistic example might be roughly described as follows: (except that in real apps we don't use Future when possible).
